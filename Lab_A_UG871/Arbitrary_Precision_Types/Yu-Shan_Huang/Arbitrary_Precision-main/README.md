# Arbitrary Precision
This is for the lab#A of the course Application Acceleration with High-Level-Synthesis and the design files are from the course.

Two different designs are in this repo:
1. Use floating-point type (in the folder `fixed-point_type`).
2. Use arbitrary precision fixed type (in the folder `arbitrary_precision_fixed_type`).

The two designs are separated in two projects, and both of them are named `window_fn_prj` following UG871.

The source codes are placed under the folders `window_fn_prj`.
